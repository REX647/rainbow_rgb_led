### Required components:
* 1 RGB LED (4-pin)
* 4 jumper wires (black, red, green, & blue)
* 3 600-ohm resistors (or stronger)
* 1 breadboard
* 1 Arduino Uno R3
### Instructions:
1. Load the _RAINBOW_RGB_LED.ino_ code into the Arduino.
2. Configure the breadboard to the schematic shown below.
3. Provide the Arduino with a power source (battery or USB) and enjoy the light show!
### Notes:
* If RGB LED does not light up, connect the black jumper wire to _GND_ instead.
* The _longest pin_ on the RGB LED is the pin that connects to power (or _GND_).
